# FUELFINDER: OPTIMIZING PIT STOPS FOR EFFICIENT ROAD TRIPS

## Product Mission
Provide road drivers all around the world with an easy-to-use application that prevents them from running out of fuel by planning and optimizing their number of refill stops with the highest rated gas stations on the way, when travelling between two cities.

## Users
Road vehicles drivers in general: this includes particular drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers, motorbike drivers...

## User Stories
1. I, any driver, want the option to input my own travelling parameters (origin, destination, fuel consume...).
2. I, any driver, want to make sure that I do not run out of fuel in the middle of my trip.
3. I, any driver, want to stop in the highest rated available gas stations.
4. I, any driver, want to have the direction of these gas stations.
5. I, any driver (but especially bus/truck), want to be able to do my long trip with the minimum number of refill stops.
6. I, any driver, want to know if I have to refill the deposit in advance if there are no gas stations in some area. 
7. I, any driver, want to have the gas stations located on a map. 
8. I, any driver, want an estimation of the fuel costs of my trip. 
9. I, any driver, want the option to save my favourite gas stations.
10. I, any driver, want to see Google Maps users reviews about the suggested gas stations.

## Getting started

Install the following library before usage:

```sh
  pip install googlemaps
  ```
Make sure to replace the Google Maps API key on the app code before running it.

## Results

Here are some simulations of the application for different cases.

1. Regular travel where several stops are needed.
